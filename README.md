> This project illustrates simple examples of using GraphQL in NodeJS + Express.

## Examples

 - [Memory](./examples/memory.js): the first example uses memory as a data source. This example was based on a [Rocketseat blog post](https://blog.rocketseat.com.br/iniciando-graphql-nodejs-expressjs/).
 - [MongoDB](./examples/mongodb.js): the second example follows the same pattern as the first but uses MongoDB as a data source. Prisma ORM is used to communicate with MongoDB. This example was based on the [Prisma ORM documentation](https://www.prisma.io/graphql).

## Install

```sh
yarn install
```
